> I write code, poems, and commit messages that age like fine sourdough starters.
{: .prompt-info }

## Elevator pitch

I build things for the web, break them locally, and write about it so future-me has someone to blame.

## What I actually do

- Ship small changes until they look big.
- Translate ideas into Markdown, bugs into features, and coffee into PRs.
- Keep Jekyll alive with ritual sacrifices to SCSS.

## Tools of choice

- Languages: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Ruby (because Jekyll said so)
- Stack: Jekyll (Chirpy), Markdown, SCSS
- Editor: VS Code + Terminal + a healthy respect for Undo

## Writing side-quest

- Poems about moons, eyes, and other untestable features.
- Essays that go somewhere eventually.

## Fun facts

- I refactor variable names like it’s cardio.
- I document things. Later. Probably.
  
> Hot take: whitespace is a feature, not a bug.
{: .prompt-tip }

## Currently

- Tweaking this blog, promising not to add “just one more” CSS rule.
- Arguing with fonts until they cooperate without !important.
