> _Fortunate are those lost inside your eyes._
>
> _Hopeless are those who must wear disguise,_
>
> _the only way they ever see_
>
> _the shadow of themselves dance with thee._
>
> _Romantics feel the fire of your touch._
>
> _Dreamers stay silent, wanting too much._
>
> _A smile, a glance—sometimes that’s all,_
>
> _enough to steady when the shadows fall._
>
> _Blessed are those who see you bare._
>
> _Brave are the ones who make you their star,_
>
> _yet shrink so small before your flame,_
>
> _building tall walls they cannot name._
>
> _Saddened are those who listen, unheard._
>
> _Lonely are those who linger, unstirred._
>
> _Winners are those at whom you smile back._
>
> _Fortunate, those with whom you share your snack._
>
> _Happy, the ones you hold in your heart._
>
> _Lucky, the souls you cannot part._
>
> _Strong are the ones who ride your lows and highs._
>
> _Fortunate are those lost inside your eyes._
