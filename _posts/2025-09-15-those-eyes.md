Fortunate are those lost inside your eyes.
Hopeless are those who must wear disguise,
the only way they ever see
the shadow of themselves dance with thee.

Romantics feel the fire of your touch.
Dreamers stay silent, wanting too much.
A smile, a glance—sometimes that’s all,
enough to steady when the shadows fall.

Blessed are those who see you bare.
Brave are the ones who make you their star,
yet shrink so small before your flame,
building tall walls they cannot name.

Saddened are those who listen, unheard.
Lonely are those who linger, unstirred.

Winners are those at whom you smile back.
Fortunate, those with whom you share your snack.
Happy, the ones you hold in your heart.
Lucky, the souls you cannot part.

Strong are the ones who ride your lows and highs.
Fortunate are those lost inside your eyes.
